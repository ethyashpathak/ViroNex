   //1.getting the user details thru frontend
   //2.Validation(did user left the email empty or stuff)
   //3.check if user already exists:username ,email..
   //4.check for images,check for avatar
   //5.upload them to cloudinary,avatar
   //6.create user object(because for uploading data to mongodb or any non-sql databases,we send it in an object form)--create entry in db
   //7.remove password and refresh token field from response(Now, when you send back a response to the frontend after registration, you donâ€™t want to expose sensitive info like:password or refresh token)
   //8.check for user creation
   //9.return response
